## Hangman
This is a game where the computer chooses a random word from the dictionary file and you have 10 chances to guess the letters.

It is also a part of TheOdinProject's [Ruby Programming](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming) course.

## Getting started

Make sure you have ruby installed on your machine by typing

```
ruby -v
```

To get started with the app, download the files and run the app by typing

```
$ ruby hangman.rb
```

And enjoy playing :D
